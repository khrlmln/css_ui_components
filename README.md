# CSS UI Components Challenges

## Overview

This project is a collection of UI components created using HTML and CSS. Each challenge includes a design file along with the assets necessary to create the UI. My goal with this repository is to improve my CSS skills by tackling challenges and practicing design techniques.

## Challenges

Each challenge is organized into its own directory. Within each directory, you'll find the following:

- `index.html`: The HTML file for the UI component.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the UI component.

## Getting Started

To view my solutions to these challenges, you can simply navigate through the directories in this repository. Each challenge is self-contained and can be viewed by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

If you're interested in contributing or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
